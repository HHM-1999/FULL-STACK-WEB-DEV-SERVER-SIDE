    "Description": "HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).Hypertext refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web. HTML uses markup to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special elements such as <head>, <title>, <body>, <header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>, <p>, <div>, <span>, <img>, <aside>, <audio>, <canvas>, <datalist>, <details>, <embed>, <nav>, <output>, <progress>, <video>, <ul>, <ol>, <li> and many others."

    "Description": "Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers according to W3C specifications. Previously, the development of various parts of CSS specification was done synchronously, which allowed the versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, or even CSS3. There will never be a CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, everything is now CSS without a version number."

    "Description": "JavaScript is a text-based programming language that allows you to create interactive elements on your web page. The World Wide Web as we know it looks nothing like the early days of grey boxes and walls of text. Nowadays, we can’t imagine browsing the web without interactive websites, clickable buttons, and online video games. The ways we interact with the internet have radically changed over the years and, for the most part, it’s all down to JavaScript. But all these new gadgets and gizmos are also putting a much larger strain on our browsers than ever before. In other words, the rise of JavaScript has also made keeping an eye on your site performance a crucial part of any online strategy. "
